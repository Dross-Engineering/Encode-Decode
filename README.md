# Encode-Decode

This simple python app lets you encode and decode text using an alphanumeric seed of any length. 
The encoded text is 100% decoupled from the input text, meaning that it is literally impossible to decode without the original seed.

Seeds can be set by the user or the 'Generate' button can be used to create a random 128 character seed which can be copied to your clipboard by pressing the 'Copy Seed' button. Note: if you havent pasted the seed to an external source before closing the app it wont remain in your clipboard, im not sure why.

Everytime you click 'Encode' a new completely random string will be generated completely different from the last and with a different random length (length will not exceed a set limit to prevent the encoded text from becoming inconveniently long).

The app works with all english characters, numbers and standard symbols and preserves new line formatting (\n).

Please feel free to use my app however i take no responsibility for any losses or damages that may come aboutas a result of using this software.

This is a ongoing passion project and new versions will likely come so please feel free to leave me requests for new features.
